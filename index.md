## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Lausanne  

## Current Research Questions  
- When cooccurring, what feature of parthenogenesis most directly contributes to the transitions from sex to asex in *Nephus voelztkowi*?
- Can rates of hybridization in Swiss ants be quantified and what factors contribute to increased hybridization between cogeners?  

## Research Interests

- **Hybridization:** introgression, genomic consequences, hybridization opportunity
- **Parthenogenesis:** transitions, genomic causes/consequences

## Timeline

- **[July. 2022]** Started Ecology and Evolution PhD at the University of Lausanne with Tanja Schwander
- **[June. 2022]** University of Lausanne. Masters of Science: Behaviour, Evolution, and Conservation w/ specialization in Computational Ecology and Evolution
- **[June. 2020]** University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Bachelor's of Science: Ecology, Evolution, & Animal Behavior/Plant and Microbial Biology/Marine Biology/Fisheries, Wildlife, & Conservation Biology
